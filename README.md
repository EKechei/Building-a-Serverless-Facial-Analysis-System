# Overview

For this project, we will explore both serverless and machine-learning services. A serverless service does not eliminate the need for servers to run your apps; rather, you will let AWS manage the servers so you can focus on development. While artificial intelligence has many components that you can use depending on your needs, weâ€™ll use the image recognition feature of Amazon Rekognition. After finishing the project, you can integrate it into an online application form to analyze the uploaded images.

# Objectives

- Create an Amazon S3 bucket with event notifications to trigger the Lambda function.
- Use Amazon Rekognition to detect faces in the uploaded image.
- If the image contains a face, populate the DynamoDB table and trigger Amazon SNS to send email notifications.

# Services:

 - Amazon S3
 - AWS Lambda
 - Amazon Rekognition
 - Amazon DynamoDB
 - Amazon SNS
